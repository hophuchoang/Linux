# Linux Programming Course

Welcome to the **Linux Programming Course**!  
This course is designed for learners who want to gain practical skills in Linux systems, focusing on low-level programming concepts such as processes, threads, IPC, and socket communication.

## ðŸ“š Course Structure

The course is divided into the following modules:

### 1. General_Knowledge
> **Overview of Linux Operating System**  
Learn the fundamentals of Linux, including system architecture, user/kernel space, basic commands, and software development tools. Understand how Linux differs from other operating systems and why it's widely used in embedded systems and servers.

### 2. File_System
> **Understanding Linux File System Hierarchy and Operations**  
Explore the structure of the Linux file system, permissions, and common file operations using system calls such as `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()`.

### 3. Process
> **Working with Processes**  
Learn how to create and manage processes using `fork()`, `exec()`, and `wait()`. Understand process states, process IDs, and how to control child-parent process interactions.

### 4. Thread
> **Multithreading in Linux**  
Understand the difference between processes and threads. Learn how to create and synchronize threads using the POSIX Threads (pthreads) API.

### 5. Socket
> **Socket Programming Basics**  
Dive into inter-process communication over the network. Learn how to create TCP/UDP client-server models using socket programming in C.

### 6. IPC Signal
> **Signals for Process Communication**  
Learn how to send and handle signals between processes. Understand common signals like `SIGINT`, `SIGKILL`, and `SIGTERM`, and implement custom signal handlers.

### 7. IPC Pipe
> **Using Pipes and Named Pipes (FIFOs)**  
Understand anonymous and named pipes for communication between related or unrelated processes. Learn practical usage through real examples.

### 8. Mini Project - TCP Chat Application
> **Build a Command-Line Chat Application using TCP Sockets**  
Put all your knowledge together by building a chat system using socket programming. Implement server-client communication, handle multiple clients, and manage message broadcasting.
